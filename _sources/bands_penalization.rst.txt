Bands Penalization
==================

The `Bands penalization` module provides functionality to penalize irregularities in Raman spectra related to the bands.
The module is divided into `Single Band` and `Band Region` functionalities, each designed to handle specific aspects of spectral data.
More information can be found on the paper.
