Information collected included:
-------------------------------
The method ``DebugCollector.all()`` return a dictionary with all the information collected during the execution of the ``getIS_Score`` function, including:

        - `sp_norm`: The normalized spectrum.
        - `baseline_norm`: The normalized baseline.
        - `peaks`: The peaks detected.
        - `peaks_edges`: The edges for each peak.
        - `dips`: The dips detected.
        - `dips_edges`: The edges for each dip.
        - `IS-Score`: the final IS-Score value.
    - `SINGLE_PEAK_PENALIZATION`: Contains the detected bands, the unsound frequencies, and the plot of the detected bands.
        - `point_for_penalization`: The list of point used as evaluation for each peak.
        - `peak_penalized`: The list of peak penalized.
        - `single_peak_penalization`: The single peak penalization value.
    - `REGION_PEAK_PENALIZATION`: Contains the penalized region peak values, the unsound frequencies, and the plot of the penalized spectrum.

        - `overfitting_penalties`: The list of overfitting penalties.
        - `overfitting_index`: The indexes where the overfitting happens.
        - `underfitting`: The list of distances between the frequency prominence and the baseline (if the frequency prominence is above the baseline)

        - `dip_region_penalization`: The dip region penalization value.
    - `INTENSITY_PENALIZATION`: Contains the penalized intensity values, the unsound frequencies, and the plot of the penalized spectrum.
        - `filtered_indexes`: The indexes of the spectrum where the intensity are penalized.
        - `intensity_penalization`: The intensity penalization value.
    - `AUC_PENALIZATION`: Contains the penalized AUC values, the unsound frequencies, and the plot of the penalized spectrum.
