Utils
===============

The `Utils` module provides a collection of utility functions that support the core functionality of the IS-Score package.
These functions include operations for printing and data preprocessing, such as normalization.

A class called ``DebugCollector`` is also defined for an easier access to the information computed by the IS-Score algorithm.
More information are available in the `DebugCollector` section.
