IS-Score documentation
======================

The IS-Score module is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the quality of baseline in Raman spectroscopy data.
By automating the assessment process, it reduce the need for manual inspection, providing a reliable and consistent metric for baseline correction.
This module incorporates algorithms to penalize irregularities in the spectrum, such as unsound peaks and dips, ensuring a robust evaluation of the baseline fitting.
Whether you are a researcher or a data analyst working with Raman spectra, the IS-Score module simplifies the process of baseline evaluation, enabling you to focus on interpreting your results with confidence.
